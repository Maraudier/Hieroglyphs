# Hieroglyphs

Personal project where I play with machine learning on Egyptian Hieroglyphs.

DBSAN / Old implementation of a DBSCAN (clustering) algorithm to localize hieroglyphs in a picture. Not working anymore.

Currently on-going : implementation of siamese neural networks with one-shot learning.
